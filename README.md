Project Overview Instagram Users
Purpose: The purpose of this SQL-based project is to analyze a dataset to derive 
meaningful insights that support data-driven decision-making. We aim to identify patterns, 
trends, and key metrics in the data by querying and aggregating information effectively. 
SQL will be used to handle data processing tasks, extract key information, and uncover 
insights to inform strategic decisions.
Approach:
Data Exploration:
Start with basic exploratory queries to understand the dataset structure, including table 
relationships, column types, and the nature of data stored.
Use SQL statements to inspect sample rows (SELECT *), check for unique values 
(DISTINCT), and calculate summary statistics (e.g., COUNT, AVG, MIN, MAX).
Analyze data distribution and identify key columns for further analysis.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
Address missing values by using conditional queries (WHERE clauses) to find incomplete 
records and apply transformations to handle them.
Data Aggregation and Transformation:
Use SQL aggregation functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG, GROUP BY) to calculate metrics like 
averages, totals, and proportions.
Perform calculations across groups (using GROUP BY) to analyze patterns within specific 
categories.
Tech-Stack Used:
DBeaver
Overview: DBeaver is an open-source database management tool that supports a wide 
range of databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQLite, and many more. It's 
widely used for SQL development, database management, and data visualization.
Features:
Cross-platform support (Windows, Mac, Linux)
SQL editor with syntax highlighting
ER diagrams, data modeling
Export/import tools for data handling
Insights
User Engagement Patterns:
Daily and Monthly Active Users: Observed a steady growth in both DAUs and MAUs, 
indicating a healthy, engaged user base. However, a significant uptick during weekends 
suggests that users are more engaged in their free time, which could inform optimal 
content posting times
Loyal User Reward: The marketing team wants to reward the most loyal users, i.e., those 
who have been using the platform for the longest time.
Inactive User Engagement: The team wants to encourage inactive users to start posting by 
sending them promotional emails.
Contest Winner Declaration: The team has organized a contest where the user with the 
most likes on a single photo wins.
Hashtag Research: A partner brand wants to know the most popular hashtags to use in 
their posts to reach the most people.
Ad Campaign Launch: The team wants to know the best day of the week to launch ads.
User Engagement: Investors want to know if users are still active and posting on Instagram 
or if they are making fewer posts.
Bots & Fake Accounts: Investors want to know if the platform is crowded with fake and 
dummy accounts.
Result
Through this project, I successfully identified key user engagement patterns and valuable 
insights on how Instagram users interact with different features. Some key achievements 
include:
Enhanced Understanding of User Behavior:
By analyzing daily and monthly active user metrics, I gained a solid understanding of 
engagement trends and peak usage periods, which can inform timing for new feature 
releases and marketing campaigns.
Feature Optimization Insights:
The analysis highlighted the popularity of Reels and interactive content, providing strong 
evidence for prioritizing these features in future development efforts. This understanding 
can drive further growth and user satisfaction by focusing on features that keep users 
engaged.
Impact of the Analysis
This project has had a significant impact by providing actionable insights that can enhance 
the Instagram experience for users, improve engagement and retention, and support 
targeted marketing and monetization strategies. For me, working on this analysis 
deepened my understanding of how user data can directly influence product development 
and business strategy. The project highlighted the critical role data analysis plays in 
shaping user-centric decisions and driving growth for a product as dynamic as Instagram.
Overall, the insights derived from this analysis have the potential to influence Instagramâ€™s 
future development, helping the product team make informed, data-driven decisions that 
align with user needs and business goals.
